    <td><p><b>Review in a Nutshell: </b>Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi is an amazing series, one of my absolute favorites! However, I think this book is best for people who are willing to devote some time to getting into the writing style and getting to know the characters.
<br><br>
        <i>“I am nothing but novocaine. I am numb, a world of nothing, all feeling and emotion gone forever.
        I am a whisper that never was.”</i></p>
        
        Shatter Me takes place in a dystopian future, where our protagonist, Juliette, has been locked away for 264 days. Why? Because she can kill people with her touch alone and has no control over this power.<br>
        When the Reestablishment decides to use her as a weapon, Juliette must decide how to stop them from turning her into the monster she has been so afraid of becoming.</p>
        <p>This book has so many amazing aspects. First, the writing style. Mafi's writing style is poetic and beautiful, allowing the reader to have a deeper understanding of Juliette's thoughts and feelings.
            I absolutely adored it. However, I do know that this style doesn't work for everyone, but I honestly feel if you keep with the book, you will grow to love it no matter your first impression.</p></td></tr></table>

   <td> <p><b>Review in a Nutshell: </b>This was such a good book, honestly a joy to read.

        When I first started reading The Cruel Prince, I felt comforted immediately.<br> When a book introduces you to a rhyming fairytale poem by Robert Graves, you know the author loves the world into which you’re about to dive.<br>
        
        I felt the need to go slow. To savour every description and detail.<br><br> Honestly, I’ve not felt like that in a while.
        
        It might have been the sunshine that was sleeping in through my living room window after a cold and brutal storm that made me feel nostalgic. But more likely, it was the setup, the pace, the scene-setting. 
        Essentially, Holly Black's writing.</p></td></tr></table>
